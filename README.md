# New Year

Script to play "In the Air Tonight" at midnight on New Year's Eve.

Requires [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/), which can be installed from PyPI.

You'll also need a copy of [In The Air Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Air_Tonight) by [Phil Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins) in [Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV). 
The timings used in this script are based on the version from the [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)) [R-Kive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Kive) box set released in 2014, with a run time of 5 minutes 30 seconds. 
My copy was downloaded as an MP3 from Amazon.
You can use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to convert from MP3 to WAV.

Then edit the script to point to your WAV file, and adjust the timings if necessary. Then simply run the script at about 11:50 PM and enjoy the music, which starts at about 11:56 PM.
